<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Lyngua is an app that is designed to create a unique experience for people learning new language vocabulary. It will accelerate learning a new language because it will let the user tailor the vocabulary practiced in the app to their environment.

The app is made up of two modes, practice and interactive. The practice mode allows
users to self-select any type of category for vocabulary practice. Interactive mode allows you to
learn a new language in a way that applies to your daily life. Using machine learning and object
identification, Lyngua recognizes when you point your camera towards an object and quickly
identifies the object and its translation. It then provides a way for you to try and identify the
translation of the object in the forms of multiple choice or filling in the word. Using this, the user
can practice and learn the vocabulary that is going to come up more frequently in day to day
life. In addition, the users can set custom goals to make sure they are continuing to learn at their
desired pace.
