Week 3 Development Log - Patrick Komban

Dates: Oct 5 to 11, 2020

Work Completed:

- Implementing Firebase user login functionality (NOTE: decided to scrap using Firebase and use Android Rooms instead as it suits the needs of our app better with image saving and learning)

- Looking into implementation details for a multiple choice game that should start when a user selects the category of choice.
