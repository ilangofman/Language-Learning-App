Week 6 Development Log - Patrick Komban

Dates: Oct 25 to Oct 31, 2020

Work Completed:

- Making it so that when a choice is selected in the MCQ game, the UI holds the frame for 3 seconds to allow the user time to see the right option.

- Added the CategoryResults fragment to display to the user their score from the game session, as well as the list of translations-english words that they got right, as well as the ones they got wrong for practicing in the future.

- Some UI cleanup of the game mode and results fragments.
