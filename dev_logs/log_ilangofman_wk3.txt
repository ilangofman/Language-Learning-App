Week 3 - Dev Log 

Dates: Oct 5 to 11, 2020

Work Completed:

Added the rooms library which is a sqlite wrapper. This will enable persistant storage for the user data. 
Added the ability to have the user be able to add a category. This will add it to the phone database. So everytime the app is restarted, the caategories are not deleted. 
Started working displaying the categories nicely. This was done with a recycler view.
